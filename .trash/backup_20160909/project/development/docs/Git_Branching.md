# Master
Represents a version update

# Development
## category and project branching
The branch for 'Simple Voting Machine' is: `voting_machine/simple` . There will be a lot of work on the voting machine, but we start by creating the simplest possible version.

- `project_category/project_name-init` - the start of a branch
- `project_category/project_name-make_new_page` - first piece
- `project_category/project_name-make_route_for_page` - second piece
- `project_category/project_name-finish_that_sweet_functionality` - last piece

## completed projects branching
When the simplest version of voting machine is done and working the final commit will be merged to branch `voting_machine`, be tested (again), and then merged to `master`.

- `project_category/project_name` - working versions that are branched from master that are being tested for release
