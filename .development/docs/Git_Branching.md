the head of a branch should always be functional unless the branch is /devel

**master - a version update**

- 'project_category/project_name/dev/init' - the start of a branch
- 'project_category/project_name/dev/make_new_page' - first piece
- 'project_category/project_name/dev/make_route_for_page' - second piece
- 'project_category/project_name/dev/finish_that_sweet_functionality' - last piece

- 'project_category/project_name' - working versions that are branched from master that are being tested for release
